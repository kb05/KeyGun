# KeyGun
A command that allows save a command and execute it multiples time using shortcuts

#### Requirements

* Zenity (sudo apt-get install zenity )

#### How works?

1. Execute the command with the charge option KeyGun.sh Charge
2. Write the command to execute in each shoot
3. Execute the command with the shoot opion /home/kb05/Apps/KeyGun/KeyGun.sh Shoot
4. Have fun with your command

***Optional:***. Assign the charge option and the shoot option to a keyboard shortcut, ( a use case that I usually use the command is copy a especific http request for my server, transform to a curl request and execute it until I find the problem that I'm trying to solve).
